	bestmove Fen ALGORITHM Depth

		Returns the best move in UCI, evaluated by ALGORITHM 
		for position specified by Fen.

		Depth is a positive integer, specifies the depth at 
		which the algorithm will search for the best move.
		Without Depth, the ALGORITHM will use its default
		configuration, which differs from algorithm to 
		algorithm. You should experiment a bit to find the
		one that fits your need best.
	
		ALGORITHM can be one of the following:
		+ minimax
		+ negamax
		+ alphabeta
		+ nullmove
		+ quiescent
