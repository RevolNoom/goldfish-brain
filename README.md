# Algorithm Tasks
1. Implementation Minimax Algorithm (done: 15/11/2021). Note: Time is large even with depth = 3, evaluation by Minh's function, plays with different type than India
2. Implementation Alpha-Beta Algorithm (done: 18/11/2021). Note: Fast time: averge 2 sev with depth = 3, evaluation by Minh's fumction -> still need time to 0.0s
3. Implementaion Quiescence Search (done: 19/11/2021). Note: Alpha-Beta based , good at first, fast time; later move is infinity lopp =(
