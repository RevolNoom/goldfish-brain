To run this project, you need python3.6.4 or higher. Any python3 probably works fine,
but we haven't tested compatibility with older versions, and won't do so.


--Installation--

1. Ubuntu
Open the terminal then run the sequence commands:

	Install python:

	    sudo apt-get update
	    sudo apt-get install python3

	Install pip/pip3:

	    sudo apt install python3-pip

	Install python chess library:

	    pip3 install python-chess


2. Windows

	Install python:
		If you do not have python in your computer, you can go this link to download python: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-385/.
		Then download python to your computer and run exe file
		Note: You must click/tick "add path to this computer" or "Add Python 3.8 to PATH" when the exe file opens.

	Install Python Chess Library

		After installing python, please open your command line then run the sequence commands:

		pip install --upgrade pip
		pip install python-chess




After successful installation, please run:

	pip show chess

and verify that the home-page of the library is: https://github.com/niklasf/python-chess  
and the author is: Niklas Fiekas

ISSUES: 
We have experienced one Windows machine cannot install python-chess through pip. 
And one Windows machine installed python-chess but it results in a completely different library. 
One Windows machine successfully installed as intended.
2/2 Linux machines successfully installed this library.
As such, we have high hope on Linux. If you are a Windows user, let's hope that this is not the case for you. Because if it is, we truly don't know what to do...


--HOW TO RUN THIS PROJECT--

There're two files of interest: EvergreenTimer.py and pychess.py, which can be found in folder Engine/
These are intended to be run on terminal. I heard that you can use Jupyter Notebook or something to run
it, but I don't know JN. Thus, you may run it in anyway you feel comfortable.

+) pychess.py: 
	This file was initially intended to only be an adapter between GUI and python engine.
	You can use it to see algorithm running time, find the best move for a position.
	For information on how to run it, you can read the text file help.pychess, or calling 
	pychess.py without any argument or with help/--help:
	
	Windows: 
		$> python pychess.py
		$> python pychess.py --help

	Linux:
		$> ./pychess.py
		or
		$> python3 pychess.py

	(Some other uses are exclusively interesting to the GUI. You may ignore them)

+) EvergreenTimer.py:
	This file is responsible for our measurements. It requires a little bit tweaking of
	the source code to run. But it's easy to understand. Promise!
	The options you may change are:
	*) Algorithm chosen to run: 
		Uncomment the algorithm you want.
		There's a default chosen algorithm already, so you may run it right now.
	*) Algorithm Depth
	*) Iteration: 
		Higher for better average running time calculation. 
		Default is 3, but you may change it to 1 if you just
			want a quick result.

	Here's how you run it:
	$> EvergreenTimer.py
	or
	$> 

-GUI-

If you don't care about GUI (for demonstration), please skip the remaining part and 
run two files above as you wish.

If you are Windows user, Chess.exe is the file you want to run.
Chess.x86_64 is for Linux users.

NOTE: Potato PCs might not be able to run the GUI because of hardware limitation.
	I hope you are interested and lucky, at the same time



~~~ Thank you, and have fun! ~~~
